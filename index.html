<h1> Raag</h1>
    In Indian classical music, we are very familar with the word <b>RAAG.</b> <br>
Many musicians have been performing the same raag with various lyrics so, we came to know that raag is not about lyrics. <br>
Many exprienced musicians say that learning all the raags is not possible.<br> Now, the question comes;<br>
<br><p1><b>What is a raag and why can't we learn all of them?</b>h2></b></p1><b> </b> <br> <br> 
<b>So basically, a raag in <i>The Indian Classical Music</i> is a combination of nodes which forms a  tune that depends on several major rules:</b><br> <br>
(1)  A  raag must have minimum <i>5</i> nodes. A rag containing 5 nodes in called <b>Audav.</b>   <br>
(2)  When it has <i>6</i> nodes it is called as <b>Shadow.</b> <br>
(3)  A raag can have maximum <i>7</i> nodes then it is said to be <b>Sampoorn.</b><br>
(4) The nodes used in the rag may deffer from aaroh to avroh.
<br><br>(<i>These AUDAV, SHADOW and SAMPOORN are called as the cast of the particular raag.</i>)
<br> <br> <div class="container"></div>
We cannot learn all the raags because following the above rules we get
a number of combinations of nodes which may form a thousands of raag and learning
all of them is not possibe for a normal human being. <br><br>
<i>Going in detail about rags ~ </i><br><br>
The raags have their own time on which they are suppose to be sung.<br>
All raags have their own nature.<br>
Raags can be performed on different beats ( taal ) like ~ TEENTAAL, TILWADATAAL etc. <br>
There are some more terms called <b>vadi, samvadi, anuvadi, thaat and vivadi.<br></b><br>
<b>Vadi:</b> it is the most used node in the raag.<br>
<b>Samvadi:</b> it is the second most used node in the raag.<br>
<b>Anuvadi:</b> except vadi and samvadi rest nodes are called as anuvadi.<br>
<b>Thaat:</b> it is the origin of the raag. Indian Classical Music have 10 of them.     <br>
<b>Vivadi:</b> vivadi nodes are not to be played during an improvisation on a raag.<br><br>
